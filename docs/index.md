Use your Raspberry Pi as a guitar effects pedal. Configure and control PiPedal with your phone or tablet.

PiPedal running on a Raspberry Pi 4 provides stable low-latency audio via external USB audio devices, or internal Raspberry Pi audio hats; and the Raspberry Pi 4's 
processor provides enough power to run even the most demanding pedal plugins.

PiPedal's user interface has been specifically designed to work well on small form-factor touch devices like phones or tablets. Clip a phone or tablet on your microphone stand on stage, and you're ready to play! Or connect via a desktop browser, for a slightly more luxurious experience. The PiPedal user-interface adapts to the screen size and orientation of your device, providing easy control of your guitar effects across a broad variety devices and screen sizes.

Set up a Wi-Fi hotspot for your phone or table to connect to using a simple setup dialog.

PiPedal includes a small selection of LV2 plugins from the ToobAmp collection of plugins. But it works with most LV2 Audio plugins. There are literally hundreds of [free high-quality LV2 audio plugins](UsingLv2Plugins.md) that will work with PiPedal.  

If your USB audio adapter has MIDI connectors, you can use MIDI controllers or keyboards to control PiPedal while performing. A simple interface allows you to select how you would like to bind MIDI messages to effect controls.
