## Choosing a USB Audio Adapter

{% include pageIcon.html %}


The quality of the audio adapter you use dramatically affects the quality of the guitar effects. Amp models are particularly sensitive to poor signal-to-noise ratios, because overdrive effects boost the level of noise more than the level of the actual signal. For best results, you should choose a 24-bit audio adapter that provides at least 105db (A-weighted) signal-to-noise ratio. 

I personally use and recommend the Motu M2 USB audio adapter, although there are plenty of other pro-quality audio adapters that will work as well. Cheaper USB audio adapters that sell for less than US$70 will almost certainly not provide adequate signal-to-noise ratio for best results.

Ideally, you want a USB adapter that provides an input volume knob, and an instrument-level input jack. For best results, you want the input signal to be as high as possible without clipping. (Clipped input signals sound horrible).

Pay close attention to the input VU meter of the first effect in your guitar effect chain. That will indicate the signal level coming into the USB adapter. Ideally, you want the value peaking solidly in the yellow range of the VU meter, and NEVER going red.

Again, the MOTU M2 excels in this regard. It provides large, volume knobs for input and output trim, along with very readable VU meters on the front  panel which indicate both input and output signal levels.
