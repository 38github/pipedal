## System Requirements

{% include pageIcon.html %}

* A Raspberry PI 4B or 400, with at least 2GB of RAM to run (4GB recommended).
* To build PiPedal, at least 4GB of RAM (8GB recommended).
* An external USB Audio Adapter, or a Pi audio hat with at least one audio input, and one audio output.

PiPedal has been tested on the following Operating Systems:

* Ubuntu 21.04 or later, 64-bit
* Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit

64-bit operating systems are preferred, as they delivery significantly higher performance than 32-bit platforms.

If you are using Raspberry Pi OS, make sure to upgrade to the latest version, because versions of the Linux kernel later than 5.10 provide important bug fixes for USB audio devices.
